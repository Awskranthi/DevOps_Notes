:What Is Linux :Linux Is A Open Source Operating System Module On Unix And Devloped In 'C'lang Open Source : 
1)A Software Become Source If Its Source Code Freely Available. 
The Free Software Moment Was Started In 1983 And 1998 Some Developers Code The Term Open Source To Make It Less And Andbiuous And Every One A Dapted To It Open
Source Project Are Generealy A Collobration Effeort By Mulitiple Product And Allow Others To Get Benfit Of It .
History Of Linux Linux Vs Unix Feacture Of Lunix:Open Source ,Monitry Cost,Huge Base,Reliable ,Licensing Freedom,Custmized,Secure .
Where Linux Is Used:Servers,Supercpmputers,Gaming And Visual Effects ,Embedded System,Andriod,Nasa 
Compents Of Linuxos:1)Init Programe-------,>Boot Loader------>>, Software Libraries(DLL)----------->,Package Managment-------->,Other Interface And Application
Init program:The first program which is respoible for the itilztion of th system ex:sysvinit,systemd 
Boot loader: a program which loads the operating system 
(Architecure Of Linux OS ): Application----->Shell-------->Kernel---------->Hardware(Architecure Of Linux OS )
Shell:The shell is the interface which takes user -command ans sendsit to the kernel
APPLICTION --->SHELL--->Kern---->HARD WARE
The kneral is the interface between the application and the actual process done ate the Hardware level . 
Tasks peformend by the kernel 1)resources Allocation :-Manage he computers resources and allow other programs to run and use these resources ,
2)security Managment: provided the security and protection from faults and maliicious behaviours, 
process management: allows the execution of application and suport tem with feacturesuch as hardware abstraction.
device management:maintains a list of available devicesand allow drives to physically acess their devices .
scheduling:gives every program specific amount of thime and can stwic from one process to another . 
Memory Managment: Allows process to safty aess the memory according to their requriments. 
SHELL:The shell is the IINTERFACE which takes USERCOMMAND and sends It to the KERNEL.
she has got its own programmng languae and yo can combine mulitiple commands in asingle script
,The shell taked the commands in human readable fromant and provides its to Kernel in bnary language.
The user generally intracts via shell ,but direct interction with hardware is also possible,
the first shell created was Sh for Unix system ,Linux still provide support for Sh shell, but Bash is more popular with in the Linux users . 
APPLICATION------SHELL------KERNEL-----HARDWARE(DEVICE, CPU,MEMORY) How Shell Works?:
-The command to be Executed or shell script ------Linux shell---------Converted to binary lang by 
Shell -----sent to Linux Kernel example :grep,awk,cat------BASH------10110000,10001100,00110011----------Linux Kernel . 
TYPES OF SHELL;-Shell --------BASH--CSHELL----KORNSHELL-------TSCHSHELl
1)bourne-again shell was written as partof the GNUprojevt to enchancethe funcionally of asha (bourie-sheel)some enchancmnt likes command complicationcommand history are done
command:--Deskops $echo shell
